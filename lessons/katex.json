That crossing point is your solution—the specific x and y that satisfies both rules at the same time. Watch the graph closely as we plot two equations and find their meeting point.",

If we know that 'y' is secretly equal to 'x minus 1', we can swap 'y' out in the other equation and replace it with 'x minus 1'. This lets us solve for x directly.",
