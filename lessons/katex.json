      "problemText": "The user needs to find the height of a triangle given its area and base. The formula is Area = (1/2) * base * height. Given Area = 36 and base AC = 12, the height BD must be 6.",
      "correctAnswer": "6",
      "customInstructions": "The user is solving for the height of a triangle (BD) given the area (36) and the base (AC = 12). The formula is A = 0.5 * b * h. The correct calculation is 36 = 0.5 * 12 * h, which simplifies to 36 = 6 * h, so h = 6. Analyze their drawing to see if they set up the formula correctly. A common mistake might be forgetting the 1/2, which would give an answer of 3. If they do this, gently remind them of the correct formula for the area of a triangle."
