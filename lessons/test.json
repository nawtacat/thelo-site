      "voiceoverScript": "In our last lesson, we balanced equations. Today, we are dealing with Inequalities—where one side is heavier than the other. We use symbols like 'greater than', 'less than', 'at least', and 'at most'. Solving these is 99% the same as solving equations: you add, subtract, and multiply just like normal. But there is one dangerous trap that catches almost every student at least once: The Negative Flip. If you multiply or divide by a negative number, the world turns upside down, and you MUST flip the inequality sign. Let's see this in action.",
