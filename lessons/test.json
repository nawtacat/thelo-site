      "voiceoverScript": "Welcome to your first SAT Algebra lesson. Before we rush into complex problems, we need to understand the core philosophy of algebra: The Balance Scale. Imagine an equation like a scale that is perfectly balanced. The equal sign in the middle tells us that the value on the left is exactly the same as the value on the right. Our goal in almost every algebra problem is to find the 'unknown'—usually called x—by stripping away everything else around it. But here is the golden rule: whatever you do to one side of the scale, you must do to the other. If you add 5 pounds to the left, you must add 5 pounds to the right. If you divide the left side by 2, you must divide the right side by 2. Today, we are going to apply this rule to solve linear equations, starting simple and moving to the ones that try to trick you.",

      "voiceoverScript": "Let's look at this equation: negative eleven plus x equals nine. We want 'x' all by itself. Right now, 'x' is being bothered by a negative eleven. How do we get rid of a negative eleven? We do the opposite. The opposite of negative eleven is positive eleven. So, we add 11 to the left side. But remember the balance scale! If we add 11 to the left, we must add 11 to the right. Negative eleven plus eleven becomes zero—it vanishes. On the right, nine plus eleven becomes twenty. So, x equals twenty.",

You might see 'n' on the left and '2n' on the right. You can't solve for 'n' if it's living in two different houses. Your first goal is to pack them up and move them into the same house. We call this 'grouping like terms'. You want all your variable terms on one side of the equal sign, and all your constant numbers on the other. Let's try one together.",

We could subtract 7n from both sides, OR we could subtract 2n from both sides. Pro tip: It is usually easier to move the *smaller* one so you stay positive. Let's subtract 2n from both sides. 7n minus 2n gives us 5n. The 2n on the right cancels out. Now we have 5n plus 3 equals negative 12. Now it's just a two-step equation. We subtract 3 from both sides... negative 12 minus 3 is negative 15. Finally, divide by 5. Negative 15 divided by 5 is negative 3.",

I like to call it the 'Handshake Rule'. If you see a number outside the parentheses, like 3 times (x minus 5), that 3 has to 'shake hands' (multiply) with the x, AND it has to shake hands with the minus 5. You can't just multiply the first one and ignore the second. That's rude, and it gives you the wrong answer. Let's look at a tricky case involving a fraction.",

So, step one: Multiply the *entire* left side by 3 and the *entire* right side by 3. On the left, the 3s cancel out, leaving 9 minus 2k. On the right, we have 3 times (k minus 2). Use the handshake rule! 3 times k is 3k, and 3 times negative 2 is negative 6. Now we have 9 minus 2k equals 3k minus 6. Can you finish it from here? Add 2k to both sides... add 6 to both sides... try it.",
