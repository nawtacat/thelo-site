      "voiceoverScript": "In our last lesson, we balanced equations. Today, we are dealing with Inequalities—where one side is heavier than the other. We use symbols like 'greater than' (>), 'less than' (<), 'at least' (≥), and 'at most' (≤). Solving these is 99% the same as solving equations: you add, subtract, and multiply just like normal. But there is one dangerous trap that catches almost every student at least once: The Negative Flip. If you multiply or divide by a negative number, the world turns upside down, and you MUST flip the inequality sign. Let's see this in action.",
