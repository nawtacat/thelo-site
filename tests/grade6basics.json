      "headline": "John has 12 cookies. He decides to give /K \\frac{1}{3} K/ of them to his friend. How many cookies does he give away?",
      "problemText": "Calculate 1/3 of 12 cookies.",
      "correctAnswer": "4",
      "solutionSteps": "1. Identify the total number of cookies (12). 2. Multiply 12 by 1/3 (or divide 12 by 3). 3. 12 / 3 = 4.",
      "customInstructions": "Make sure the student multiplies by the fraction rather than subtracting it from the whole number."

      "headline": "Solve for /K x K/ in the following equation: /K 2x + 5 = 15 K/.",
      "problemText": "Solve for x: 2x + 5 = 15",
      "correctAnswer": "5",
      "solutionSteps": "1. Subtract 5 from both sides: 2x = 10. 2. Divide by 2: x = 5.",
