      "problemText": "A gym has a $50 sign-up fee and costs $25 per month. What is the total cost for 6 months?",
      "correctAnswer": "$200",
      "solutionSteps": "1. Identify the one-time fee ($50) and the monthly rate ($25).\n2. The total cost C is C = (monthly rate * months) + sign-up fee.\n3. C = (25 * 6) + 50 = 150 + 50 = 200.",
      "customInstructions": "Remember that the $50 fee is paid only once, while the $25 fee is paid every month. First, find the total monthly cost, then add the one-time fee."

      "headline": "A shirt is on sale for 20% off. The sale price is $48. What was the original price of the shirt?",
      "problemText": "After a 20% discount, a shirt costs $48. What was its original price?",
      "correctAnswer": "$60",
      "solutionSteps": "1. A 20% discount means the shirt costs 80% (or 0.8) of its original price (P).\n2. Set up the equation: 0.8 * P = 48.\n3. Solve for P: P = 48 / 0.8 = 60.",
      "customInstructions": "If the discount is 20%, the sale price is 80% of the original. Let 'P' be the original price and solve the equation 0.8 * P = 48."

      "problemText": "Given 3x - 5 = 10, find the value of 6x - 10.",
      "correctAnswer": "20",
      "solutionSteps": "1. First, solve for x: 3x = 10 + 5 -> 3x = 15 -> x = 5.\n2. Now substitute x=5 into the second expression: 6(5) - 10 = 30 - 10 = 20.\n**Alternative Method:**\n1. Notice 6x - 10 is 2 * (3x - 5).\n2. Since 3x - 5 = 10, the answer is 2 * 10 = 20.",
      "customInstructions": "You can solve for x first, then plug it into the second expression. Or, look for a relationship between 3x - 5 and 6x - 10."
